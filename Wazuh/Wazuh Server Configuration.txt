1. Initial configuration:
Indicate your deployment configuration, create the SSL certificates to encrypt communications between the Wazuh components, and generate random passwords to secure your installation.

Download the Wazuh installation assistant and the configuration file.


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/wazuh-install.sh
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/config.yml

Edit ./config.yml and replace the node names and IP values with the corresponding names and IP addresses. You need to do this for all Wazuh server, Wazuh indexer, and Wazuh dashboard nodes. Add as many node fields as needed.


nodes:
  # Wazuh indexer nodes
  indexer:
    - name: node-1
      ip: "192.168.190.131"

  # Wazuh server nodes
  # If there is more than one Wazuh server
  # node, each one must have a node_type
  server:
    - name: wazuh-1
      ip: "192.168.190.131"

  # Wazuh dashboard nodes
  dashboard:
    - name: dashboard
      ip: "192.168.190.131"
Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --generate-config-files to generate the Wazuh cluster key, certificates, and passwords necessary for installation. You can find these files in ./wazuh-install-files.tar.


bash wazuh-install.sh --generate-config-files
Copy the wazuh-install-files.tar file to all the servers of the distributed deployment, including the Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer, and the Wazuh dashboard nodes. This can be done by using the scp utility.


2. Wazuh server cluster installation:

Download the Wazuh installation assistant.


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/wazuh-install.sh

Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-server followed by the node name to install the Wazuh server. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml for the initial configuration, for example, wazuh-1.

Note Make sure that a copy of the wazuh-install-files.tar, created during the initial configuration step, is placed in your working directory.

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-server wazuh-Nuerawall

Your Wazuh server is now successfully installed.


3. Wazuh dashboard installation: 

Download the Wazuh installation assistant. You can skip this step if you have already installed Wazuh indexer on the same server.


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/wazuh-install.sh

Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-dashboard and the node name to install and configure the Wazuh dashboard. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml for the initial configuration, for example, dashboard.

Note Make sure that a copy of the wazuh-install-files.tar file, created during the initial configuration step, is placed in your working directory.

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-dashboard dashboard

The default Wazuh web user interface port is 443, used by the Wazuh dashboard. You can change this port using the optional parameter -p|--port <PORT_NUMBER>. Some recommended ports are 8443, 8444, 8080, 8888, and 9000.

Once the Wazuh installation is completed, the output shows the access credentials and a message that confirms that the installation was successful.


INFO: --- Summary ---
INFO: You can access the web interface https://192.168.190.131
   User: admin
   Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>

INFO: Installation finished.
You now have installed and configured Wazuh. Find all passwords that the Wazuh installation assistant generated in the wazuh-passwords.txt file inside the wazuh-install-files.tar archive. To print them, run the following command:


tar -O -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt
Access the Wazuh web interface with your admin user credentials. This is the default administrator account for the Wazuh indexer and it allows you to access the Wazuh dashboard.

URL: https://<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>

Username: admin

Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
