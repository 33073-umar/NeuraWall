Tunnel Settings

IPv4 Tunnel Network
10.0.0.0/24

Redirect IPv4 Gateway = Force all client-generated IPv4 traffic through the tunnel.

Concurrent connections
10

Allow Compression
Refuse any non-stub compression (Most secure)

Client Settings
Dynamic IP = Allow connected clients to retain their connections if their IP address changes.
Topology
Subnet -- One IP address per client in a common subnet

Ping settings
Inactive = 30000

Ping method
keepalive -- Use keepalive helper to define ping configuration
keepalive helper uses interval and timeout parameters to define ping and ping-restart values as follows:

Interval
10

Timeout
30
